    "section": "",
    "text": "If you went back in time two years ago and told the average college football fan that Indiana football would be one of the best teams in the Big Ten, nay, arguably THE best team in the country, let alone the Big Ten, you would be laughed out of whatever sports bar you had time traveled to.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(cfbfastR)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n\nAnd yet, here in 2025, Indiana football is ranked no. 2, is undefeated, and is perhaps one of the scariest teams in all of college football since 2019 LSU (And I’ll stand by that take).\nSo the question is: how? How did IU football, known for being perennially mediocre and having (as of August 2025) the second worst all-time win-loss record in all of FBS, become so good so fast?\nThe answer is Curt Cignetti.\nSince he stepped foot in Bloomington for the 2024 season, Coach Cignetti has established himself as an all-gas, no-brakes, boot-on-the-throat-of-your-enemy type of coach. The common narrative surrounding this Indiana team is by how many points they beat other teams by. So let’s take a look at the Hoosiers’ point differential under Cignetti last season compared to the rest of the Big Ten.\n\n\nCode\nBigTen24 &lt;- read_csv(\"footballlogs24.csv\")|&gt;\n  filter(Conference ==  \"Big Ten Conference\")\n\nBigTen23 &lt;- read_csv(\"footballlogs23.csv\")|&gt;\n  filter(Conference ==  \"Big Ten Conference\")\n\nBigDiff24 &lt;- read_csv(\"footballlogs24.csv\")|&gt;\n  filter(Conference ==  \"Big Ten Conference\")|&gt;\n  mutate(point_diff = TeamScore - OpponentScore)|&gt;\n  group_by(Team)|&gt;\n  summarize(season_diff = sum(point_diff))\nBigDiff23 &lt;- read_csv(\"footballlogs23.csv\")|&gt;\n  filter(Conference ==  \"Big Ten Conference\")|&gt;\n  mutate(point_diff = TeamScore - OpponentScore)|&gt;\n  group_by(Team)|&gt;\n  summarize(season_diff = sum(point_diff))\n\niudiff24&lt;- BigDiff24 |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\")\n\niudiff23&lt;- BigDiff23 |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\")\n\nbar24 &lt;- ggplot()+\n  geom_bar(data = BigDiff24, aes(x=reorder(Team, season_diff), weight=season_diff), fill=\"lightgrey\")+\n  geom_bar(data=iudiff24, aes(x=reorder(Team, season_diff), weight=season_diff), fill = \"#990000\") + theme_minimal() + coord_flip()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Season Total Point Differential\", \n    y=\"Team Name\", \n    title=\"This 2024 Indiana squad had one of the best Big Ten point differentials.\", \n    subtitle=\"This helped by their numerous blowout wins (Like 73-0 against Indiana State).\", \n    caption=\"Source: College Football Logs 2024 | By Evan Boldt\"\n    )\n\nbar23 &lt;- ggplot()+\n  geom_bar(data = BigDiff23, aes(x=reorder(Team, season_diff), weight=season_diff),fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=iudiff23, aes(x=reorder(Team, season_diff), weight=season_diff), fill = \"#990000\")+ theme_minimal() + coord_flip()+\n  labs(\n  x=\"Season Total Point Differential\", \n    y=\"Team Name\", \n    title=\"This Indiana team couldn't score and got scored on a lot.\", \n    subtitle=\"This was one of the worst Power 5 teams in 2023.\", \n    caption=\"Source: College Football Logs 2023 | By Evan Boldt\"\n    )\n\nbar24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty good, all things considered. That puts the season point differential of 2024’s IU - in Cignetti’s first year no less - right behind the Ohio State team that would go on to win it all.\nNow, how does Cignetti’s team in his first season with Indiana compare to the Hoosiers in the season prior?\n\n\nCode\nbar23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich makes sense, since that 2023 Indiana team went 1-8 in the Big Ten and 3-9 overall. Not a great football team. For reference, the 2023 team with the highest point differential in the Big Ten (Michigan) would go on to win the National Championship, just like the following year, so clearly this point differential thing translates to winning football games.\nSo what witchcraft did Curt Cignetti perform to elevate a 3-9, second-worst point differential team to an 11-2, second-best point differential College Football Playoff contender?\nWe know that the Hoosiers were able to score a whole lot more than their opponents. They were also one of the most prolific teams at moving and stopping the ball in 2024.\n\n\nCode\nBigWL24 &lt;- BigTen24|&gt;\n  mutate(wins = case_when(\n    grepl(\"W\", Outcome) ~ 1,\n    grepl(\"L\", Outcome) ~ 0))\n\nBigYPP24 &lt;- BigWL24 |&gt;\n  group_by(Team, Conference) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    TotalPlays = sum(OffensivePlays), \n    TotalYards = sum(OffensiveYards), \n    DefensivePlays = sum(DefPlays), \n    DefensiveYards = sum(DefYards), \n    TotalWins = sum(wins)) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    OffensiveYPP = TotalYards/TotalPlays, \n    DefensiveYPP = DefensiveYards/DefensivePlays)\n\nIUYPP24 &lt;- BigYPP24 |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=BigYPP24, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.3) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=IUYPP24, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"#990000\")+\n  scale_size(range = c(3,8), name=\"Wins\")+\n  geom_text_repel(data = BigYPP24, aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label = Team))+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Offensive Yards Per Play\", \n    y=\"Defensive Yards Per Play\", \n    title=\"This Indiana squad was up there with blue bloods Ohio State and Penn State.\", \n    subtitle=\"Their defense was up there, too (bolstered by their shutouts against Purdue and Indiana State).\", \n    caption=\"Source: College Football Logs 2024 | By Evan Boldt\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s take a look at the state of things 2023.

What is your point?”\nMy point is that the real difference between IU of old and IU of the modern day can be attributed primarily to how Cignetti’s team executes on both offense and defense. This can be quantified by a little stat called Success Rate.\nOn offense, success rate is found by dividing the number of successful plays by the total number of plays. A play on offense is considered successful if the offense gains a certain percentage of yards needed for a first down. So, an offensive success would be at least 40%-50% of yards needed on first down, 60% on second down, and 100% on a third or fourth down. What is defensive success rate? The inverse, measured in opposing offensive success rate.\nNow with the long-winded explanation out of the way, what was 2023 Indiana’s offense and defensive success rate?\n\n\nCode\nStatsAdv23 &lt;- cfbd_stats_season_advanced(2023)\nStatsAdv24 &lt;- cfbd_stats_season_advanced(2024)\n\nBigAdv23 &lt;- StatsAdv23 |&gt;\n  filter(conference == \"Big Ten\")|&gt;\n  group_by(team, conference)\nBigAdv24 &lt;- StatsAdv24 |&gt;\n  filter(conference == \"Big Ten\")|&gt;\n  group_by(team, conference)\niuAdv23&lt;-BigAdv23|&gt;\n  filter(team == \"Indiana\")\niuAdv24&lt;-BigAdv24|&gt;\n  filter(team == \"Indiana\")\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_point(data=BigAdv23, aes(x=off_success_rate, y=def_success_rate), color=\"grey\")+\n  geom_point(data=iuAdv23, aes(x=off_success_rate, y=def_success_rate), color=\"#990000\")+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.4339536)+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.4052588)+\n  geom_text_repel(data=BigAdv23, aes(x=off_success_rate, y=def_success_rate, label = team))+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Offensive Success Rate (by percentage)\", \n    y=\"Defensive Success Rate (by percentage)\", \n    title=\"2023 Indiana was not very efficient on offense.\", \n    subtitle=\"Their defensive success rate was not much better.\", \n    caption=\"Source: cfbfastR | By Evan Boldt\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s compare that with 2024’s Indiana.\n\n\nCode\nggplot()+\n  geom_point(data=BigAdv24, aes(x=off_success_rate, y=def_success_rate), color=\"grey\")+\n  geom_point(data=iuAdv24, aes(x=off_success_rate, y=def_success_rate), color=\"#990000\")+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.4411546)+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.4152041)+\n  geom_text_repel(data=BigAdv24, aes(x=off_success_rate, y=def_success_rate, label = team))+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Offensive Success Rate (by percentage)\", \n    y=\"Defensive Success Rate (by percentage)\", \n    title=\"This Indiana team was the most efficient team in the entire Big Ten on offense.\", \n    subtitle=\"Their defensive success rate was also pretty great (Shutouts help).\", \n    caption=\"Source: cfbfastR | By Evan Boldt\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo in addition to that high-flying offense, Indiana’s defense has experienced a renaissance of its own as well.\nUltimately, that 2024 IU team was unable to compete with the highest echelons of college football, with their explosive offense being quelled by top defenses and their surprisingly staunch defense not being able to keep up. But their newfound offensive prowess was and still remains the main narrative surrounding Curt Cignetti’s team and their unprecedented improvement from 2023.\nNow, in 2025, he’s hungry for more, and we’ll have to see if that high-powered offense and rock-solid defense can finally get it done."

Obviously that isn’t true, because otherwise the Cornhuskers wouldn’t win a single game, but narratives persist for a reason. So why does this one?\nTo begin with, let’s have a look at the Rhule Era’s offensive success in the Big Ten to see if this narrative has any merit. We’re going to determine this by how many drives the Big Red offense was given to work compared to whether or not they scored on those drives.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(cfbfastR)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(scales)\n\ndrives23 &lt;- cfbd_drives(\n  2023,\n  season_type = \"regular\"\n) |&gt;  \n  mutate(season=2023)\n\ndrives24 &lt;- cfbd_drives(\n  2024,\n  season_type = \"regular\"\n) |&gt;  \n  mutate(season=2024)\n\ndrives25 &lt;- cfbd_drives(\n  2025,\n  season_type = \"regular\"\n) |&gt;  \n  mutate(season=2025)\n\ndrives &lt;- bind_rows(drives23, drives24, drives25)|&gt;\n  mutate(team_season = paste(offense, season))\n\nbigtotaldrives &lt;- drives|&gt;\n  filter(offense_conference == \"Big Ten\")|&gt;\n  group_by(offense)|&gt;\n  summarise(totaldrives = n())\n\nbigtotalscores&lt;-drives|&gt;\n  filter(offense_conference == \"Big Ten\")|&gt;\n  group_by(offense)|&gt;\n  filter(scoring == \"TRUE\")|&gt;\n  summarise(totalscoringdrives = n())\n\ndrivestacked &lt;- bigtotaldrives |&gt; inner_join(bigtotalscores) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -offense, \n    names_to = \"type\",\n    values_to = \"drives\"\n  )\n  \n\ndrivestackedtwo &lt;- drivestacked |&gt;\n  mutate(type = gsub(\"totaldrives\", \"Total Drives\", type, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(type = gsub(\"totalscoringdrives\", \"Total Scoring Drives\", type, fixed=TRUE))\n  \nggplot()+\n  geom_bar(data = drivestackedtwo, aes(x=reorder(offense, drives), weight=drives, fill=type)) +\n  coord_flip()+\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Total Drives\" = \"lightgrey\",\n      \"Total Scoring Drives\" = \"red\"\n    )\n  )+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20,face = \"bold\"),\n       legend.text.position = \"none\" ,\n       legend.position = \"none\"\n        )+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Team\",\n    y=\"Total Offensive Drives\\n(Total Scores in Red)\",\n    title=\"In three years of Matt Rhule, Nebraska is\\nnear the bottom of the Big Ten in total drives\\nand scores\",\n    subtitle = \"The Huskers are in the company of some really bad programs.\n*Note: Only two seasons of play are represented here by the former Pac-12 schools. \\n(And Oregon scored more in those two seasons than Nebraska did in three!)\",\n    caption = \"Source: cfbfastR | By Evan Boldt\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, at first glance the narrative seems correct.\nIs there at least any improvement for Nebraska’s offense since Rhule came to town? Let’s see.\nWe’re going to quantify that with scoring success rate, or what percentage of drives for the given season ended in a score.\n\n\nCode\nYearlySuccess&lt;-drives|&gt;\n  filter(offense_conference == \"Big Ten\")|&gt;\n  group_by(offense)|&gt;\n  mutate(GamesPlayed= TRUE + FALSE) |&gt; \n  group_by(offense, season) |&gt;  \n  summarize(\n  Score=sum(ifelse(scoring==TRUE, 1, 0)),\n  Total=sum(GamesPlayed)) |&gt;  \n  mutate(SuccessRate=Score/Total) |&gt; \n  filter(Total&gt;5) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(SuccessRate))\n\nYearlyBigSuccess &lt;- YearlySuccess|&gt;\n  filter(offense == \"Nebraska\"|offense==\"Michigan\"|offense==\"Illinois\"|offense==\"Indiana\"|offense==\"MichiganState\"|offense==\"Northwestern\"|offense==\"Purdue\"|offense==\"Minnesota\"|offense==\"Wisconsin\"|offense==\"Ohio State\"|offense== \"Maryland\"|offense==\"Rutgers\"|offense==\"Penn State\"|offense==\"Iowa\")\n\nNUYearlySuccess &lt;- YearlyBigSuccess|&gt;\n  filter(offense == \"Nebraska\")\n\nIAYearlySuccess &lt;- YearlyBigSuccess|&gt;\n  filter(offense == \"Iowa\")\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_line(data = YearlyBigSuccess, aes(x=season, y=SuccessRate, group=offense))+\n  geom_line(data = NUYearlySuccess, aes(x=season, y=SuccessRate, group=offense), color=\"red\")+\n  geom_line(data = IAYearlySuccess, aes(x=season, y=SuccessRate, group=offense), color=\"gold\")+\n  facet_wrap(~offense)+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2023,2024,2025))+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0.2,0.4,0.6), labels = percent)+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20,face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6))+\n  labs(\n    x= \"Year by Year\",\n    y= \"Scoring Success Rate\",\n    title = \"Nebraska was bad to start Rhule's tenure\\nOne of the worst in the Big Ten, in fact\",\n    subtitle = \"However, the program has shown steady improvement year-by-year.

Which is good, right? The offense is scoring more often, that must mean the team is good now, correct?\nWell, there’s another part of this “Nebraska can’t score” narrative that I want to take a look at: Nebraska is terrible at finishing drives in the redzone. Nebraska can’t score the ever-elusive redzone touchdown. This is arguably one the most important parts of this narrative, and where I believe a lot of the stigma comes from.\nPeople say, “Nebraska can move the ball well enough, but when they get into the redzone, everything falls apart.”\nSo let’s see if “people” are right.\nTo figure this out, I’ve come up with two stats: Redzone Stalls and Redzone Successes. A Redzone Stall is any drive that ends in the redzone without a touchdown. Interception, field goal, turnover on downs, you name it. A Redzone Success is anything that’s not that. So, a touchdown, or the best case scenario for any given drive. Now, this data includes all touchdowns scored by Nebraska over the three Matt Rhule years because, technically speaking, those drives passed through the redzone at some point.\nIn any case, the main goal of the graph is to see how many Husker drives stalled in the redzone, compared to how many touchdowns they were able to score, so let’s have a look.\n\n\nCode\nbigredzonestalls &lt;- drives |&gt;\n  filter(offense_conference == \"Big Ten\")|&gt;\n  group_by(team_season)|&gt;\n  filter(end_yards_to_goal &lt;= 20 & end_yards_to_goal&gt; 0)|&gt;\n  summarise(totalredzonestalls = n())\n\nbigredzonesuccesses &lt;- drives|&gt;\n  filter(offense_conference == \"Big Ten\")|&gt;\n  group_by(team_season)|&gt;\n  filter(drive_result == \"TD\")|&gt;\n  summarise(totaltouchdowns = n())\n\nbigredzoneoutcomes &lt;- bigredzonestalls|&gt; \n  inner_join(bigredzonesuccesses)\n\nnebredzoneoutcomes &lt;-bigredzoneoutcomes|&gt;\n  filter(grepl(\"Nebraska\", team_season))\n\niuredzoneoutcomes &lt;-bigredzoneoutcomes|&gt;\n  filter(grepl(\"Indiana\", team_season))\n\niaredzoneoutcomes &lt;-bigredzoneoutcomes|&gt;\n  filter(grepl(\"Iowa\", team_season))\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_point(data=bigredzoneoutcomes, aes(x=totaltouchdowns, y=totalredzonestalls),color=\"darkgrey\")+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 21.3)+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 37.56)+\n  geom_point(data=nebredzoneoutcomes, aes(x=totaltouchdowns, y=totalredzonestalls), color=\"red\")+\n  geom_point(data=iuredzoneoutcomes, aes(x=totaltouchdowns, y=totalredzonestalls), color=\"maroon\")+\n  geom_point(data=iaredzoneoutcomes, aes(x=totaltouchdowns, y=totalredzonestalls), color=\"gold\")+\n  geom_text_repel(data=nebredzoneoutcomes, aes(x=totaltouchdowns, y=totalredzonestalls, label=team_season))+\n  geom_text_repel(data=iuredzoneoutcomes, aes(x=totaltouchdowns, y=totalredzonestalls, label=team_season))+\n  geom_text_repel(data=iaredzoneoutcomes, aes(x=totaltouchdowns, y=totalredzonestalls, label=team_season))+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"))+\n  labs(\n    x= \"Redzone Successes\",\n    y=\"Redzone Stalls\",\n    title = \"Nebraska has had roughly ten more successes\\nthan stalls in each year\",\n    subtitle = \"Compare NU to Iowa, a similar program, and Indiana, a now-truly elite program.\",\n    caption = \"Source: cfbfastR | By Evan Boldt\"\n  )+\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 22, y = 40, label = \"Many Stalls, Few Scores\\n(Bad AND Inefficient)\", size = 3, color = \"blue\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 22, y = 16, label = \"Few Stalls, Few Scores\\n(Bad BUT Efficient)\", size = 3, color = \"blue\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 52, y = 37, label = \"Many Stalls, Many Scores\\n(Lots of Variance in Success)\", size = 3, color = \"blue\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 50, y = 12, label = \"Few Stalls, Many Scores\\n(Elite Offense)\", size = 3, color = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat this means is that while there has been marked improvement in total drive opportunities for the Big Red, and in turn more touchdowns scored, the same can be said for drives stalled in the redzone. So not bad, but not great either.\nIn short, Nebraska does score the ball. But they stall out in the redzone nearly as much as they score, which isn’t conducive to the championship-winning ways that so many Husker fans want to see a return to. They’re conducive to mediocrity. Which, in year three of the Matt Rhule experience, is what Nebraska is: mediocre. Will that change in year four or five? Only time will tell.\nBut what is certain is that the narrative of the Huskers being unable to score when they need to has at least a little merit, and it’s up to Matt Rhule and Co. to defeat that narrative in year four."
